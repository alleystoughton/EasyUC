This test fails because test.uc is valid and correct .uc file
and ucdsl returns exit code 0 and no warning or error message.
But our outcome descrption has a warning 'sample'.

As ucdsl outcome is different from the TEST outcome description
after the initial run a CONFLICT file is created.

For this test to pass, outcome description of the TEST file should
be deleted as well as the CONFLICT file.

As long as the CONFLICT file exits, this test will be skipped
