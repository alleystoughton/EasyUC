This directory contains 3 subdirectories

1. sampletest1OK
2. sampletest2OK

After initial run of dsl-test a ./sampletest3/CONFLICT
is created.

Until this conflict is resolved and CONFLICT file is removed
this test will be skipped.

Each of the three directories contains

2. test.uc
3. readme

readme is a text file.
